//  Maps Can be said to be an Associative Array
//  Depends on : Key(Not Index; Can't be repeated; repetition will override) With Value
//  C# , Python : The Map is Called : Dictionary.

//  in c++ ; std::map is a container in the STL (Standard Template Library) that represents an (Associative Arry)
//  It is a Sorted Assciative Container that contains (key-value) pairs ; where each key must be unique
//  Elements are sorted based on the keys!  Which are sorted in ascending order by default & this sorting allows for efficient search, insert , delete of elements
//
