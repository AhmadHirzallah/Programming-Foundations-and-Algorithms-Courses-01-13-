/*
Many times; you dont need to see variables and functions that you dont use in your work 
or running or developing so when you call class they shouldnot be called or seen 

like camera button; it is a function called ; ft_take_picture() ; 
but it has 100 functions or more you dont need to see them.

these 100 functions isnot usefull for you ; and they are useless 
because they will make you distracted and make noise. 

Abstraction is different from abstract class
