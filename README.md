  ├── 155_c_check_is_it_a_leap_year.c
  └── ... (more problems up to 213)
```

### **4. C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (Courses 10)**

This section introduces **C++** and Object-Oriented Programming principles, focusing on encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.

```
📂 08__oop_concepts
  ├── 01_classes_vs_objects.cpp
  ├── 02_access_specifiers__modifiers.cpp
  └── ... (more OOP concepts)
```

### **5. Practical Projects (Courses 07 & 05)**

This section includes real-world projects such as a **Bank Management System**, with enhanced features like transaction management in **C++**.

```
